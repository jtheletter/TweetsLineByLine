'The Hovitos are near.',
'The poison is still fresh, three days.',
'They’re following us.',
'If they knew we were here, they would’ve killed us already.',
'SOUTH AMERICA\n1936',
'This is it.',
'This is where Forrestal cashed in.',
'A friend of yours?',
'A competitor.',
'He was good.',
'He was very, very good.',
'Señor, nobody’s come out of there alive.',
'Please…',
'Señor.',
'Stop.',
'Stay out of the light.',
'Forrestal.',
'Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here.',
'That’s what scares me.',
'Stay here.',
'If you insist, señor.',
'Give me the whip.',
'Throw me the idol.',
'No time to argue.',
'Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip.',
'Give me the whip!',
'Adios, señor.',
'Adios, Satipo.',
'Dr. Jones.',
'Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.',
'And you thought I had given up.',
'You chose the wrong friends. This time it will cost you.',
'Too bad the Hovitos don’t know you the way I do, Belloq.',
'Yes, too bad.',
'You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos.',
'Jock! Start the engines! Get it up!',
'Jock, the engines! Start the engines, Jock!',
'There’s a big snake in the plane, Jock!',
'Oh, that’s just my pet snake Reggie!',
'I hate snakes, Jock! I hate ‘em!',
'Come on! Show a little backbone, will ya?',
'“Neo” meaning “new”. And “Lithic”… “I-T-H, I-C”… meaning “stone”.',
'All right, let’s get back to this site. Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.',
'Contains a central passage and three chambers, or cysts…',
'…don’t confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow.',
'This site also demonstrates…',
'…one of the great dangers of archeology, not to life and limb—although that does sometimes take place.',
'No, I’m talking about folklore.',
'In this case, local tradition held that there was a golden coffin buried at the site.',
'And this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find.',
'However—chamber three was undisturbed.',
'And the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another, uh—in the area, give us a r… uh…',
'…reason to da—to, uh… to-to date this, uh… find as we have. Um…',
'Any questions, then?',
'No? Okay, that’s it for the day, then.',
'Um, don’t forget: Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time.',
'And I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday.',
'I had it, Marcus.',
'I had it in my hand.',
'What happened?',
'Guess.',
'Belloq?',
'You want to hear about it?',
'Not at all.',
'I’m sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the International Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.',
'It’s beautiful, Marcus.',
'I can get it. I got it all figured out.',
'There’s only one place he can sell it: Marrakech.',
'I need two thousand dollars. Look…',
'Listen to me, old boy. I brought some people to see you.',
'Look. I got these pieces.',
'They’re good pieces, Marcus. Look.',
'Indiana…',
'Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked. Yes, they are nice.',
'They’re worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.',
'But the people I brought are important, and they’re waiting.',
'What people?',
'Army Intelligence.',
'They knew you were coming before I did.',
'Seem to know everything.',
'They wouldn’t tell me what they want.',
'Well, what do I want to see them for?',
'What am I, in trouble?',
'Yes, Dr. Jones, we’ve heard a great deal about you.',
'Have you?',
'Uh, professor of archeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?',
'Obtainer of rare antiquities.',
'That’s one way of saying it.',
'Why don’t you sit down? You’ll be more comfortable.',
'Oh, thank you.',
'Thank you.',
'Yes, you’re a man of many talents.',
'Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago.',
'Yes, I did.',
'You have no idea of his present whereabouts?',
'Uh… well, just rumors, really.',
'Somewhere in Asia, I think.',
'I haven’t really spoken to him for ten years.',
'We were friends, but, uh… had a bit of a falling out, I’m afraid.',
'Mmm.',
'Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?',
'I understand.',
'Uh…',
'Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a… a German communique that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.',
'Now, to Cairo…',
'See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.',
'Hitler’s a nut on the subject.',
'He’s crazy.',
'He’s obsessed with the occult.',
'And, right now, apparently, there’s some kind of German archeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo.',
'Now, we’ve got some information here, but we can’t make anything out of it, and maybe you can.',
'“Tanis development proceeding.',
'“Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.',
'“Abner Ravenwood, U.S.”',
'The Nazis have discovered Tanis.',
'Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?',
'Well, it…',
'The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.',
'The Lost Ark?',
'Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.',
'The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.',
'What do you mean, “Commandments”?',
'You talking about the Ten Commandments?',
'Yes, the actual Ten Commandments.',
'The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing.',
'Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?',
'Well, I…',
'Oh, look.',
'The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon.',
'In Jerusalem.',
'Where it stayed for many years.',
'Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it’s gone.',
'Where?',
'Well, nobody knows where or when.',
'However, an Egyptian pharaoh…',
'Shishak.',
'Yes.',
'…Invaded the city of Jerusalem right about 980 BC, and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls.',
'Secret chamber?',
'However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year.',
'Wiped clean by the wrath of God.',
'Uh-huh.',
'Obviously we’ve come to the right men.',
'Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then.',
'No, no, not really.',
'Ravenwood is the real expert.',
'Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.',
'Collected some of its relics.',
'It was his obsession, really.',
'But he never found the city.',
'Frankly, we’re somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.',
'An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.',
'Oh, rubbish. Ravenwood’s no Nazi.',
'Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?',
'Well, obviously the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, and they think Abner’s got it.',
'What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?',
'Well, the staff is just a stick…',
'I don’t know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high…',
'And it’s… it’s, uh… it’s capped with an elaborate headpiece… in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center.',
'And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis…',
'A map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor, and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here… and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.',
'Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?',
'Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.',
'What does this Ark look like?',
'Uh…',
'There’s a picture of it right here.',
'That’s it.',
'Good God.',
'Yes, that’s just what the Hebrews thought.',
'Uh… now, what’s that supposed to be coming out of there?',
'Lightning… fire… power of God or something.',
'I’m beginning to understand Hitler’s interest in this.',
'Oh, yes.',
'The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions.',
'An army which carries the Ark before it… is invincible.',
'You did it, didn’t you?',
'They want you to go for it.',
'Oh, Marcus!',
'They want you to get a hold of the Ark before the Nazis do, and they’re prepared to pay handsomely for it.',
'And the museum?',
'The museum gets the Ark when we’re finished?',
'Oh, yes.',
'Oh…',
'The Ark of the Covenant.',
'Nothing else has come close.',
'That thing represents everything we got into archeology for in the first place.',
'Mmm!',
'You know, five years ago, I would’ve gone after it myself.',
'I’m really rather envious.',
'I’ve got to locate Abner.',
'I think I know where to start.',
'Suppose she’ll still be with him?',
'Possibly, but…',
'Marion’s the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy.',
'What do you mean?',
'Well, I mean that for nearly three thousand years, man has been searching for the Lost Ark.',
'Not something to be taken lightly.',
'No one knows its secrets.',
'It’s like nothing you’ve ever gone after before.',
'Oh, Marcus.',
'What are you trying to do, scare me?',
'You sound like my mother.',
'We’ve known each other for a long time.',
'I don’t believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.',
'I’m going after a find of incredible historical significance.',
'You’re talking about the bogeyman.',
'Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.',
'Nice to see you again, Dr. Jones.',
'Thank you.',
'Shh… shh…',
'Shh…',
'Give him space! Give him space!',
'Go on, Regan!',
'Shh! Shh!',
'Shh! Shh! Shh!',
'Hello, Marion.',
'Indiana Jones.',
'Always knew, someday, you’d come walking back through my door.',
'I never doubted that.',
'Something made it inevitable.',
'So, what are you doing here in Nepal?',
'I need one of the pieces your father collected.',
'I learned to hate you in the last ten years.',
'I never meant to hurt you.',
'I was a child.',
'I was in love.',
'It was wrong and you knew it!',
'You knew what you were doing.',
'Now I do! This is my place.',
'Get out!',
'I did what I did.',
'You don’t have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now.',
'I need one of the pieces your father collected.',
'Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal.',
'You know the one I mean?',
'Yeah.',
'I know it.',
'Where’s Abner?',
'Abner’s dead.',
'Marion, I’m sorry.',
'Do you know what you did to me, to my life?',
'I can only say I’m sorry so many times.',
'Well, say it again, anyway.',
'Sorry.',
'Yeah, everybody’s sorry.',
'Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.',
'I’m sorry to still be stuck in this dive.',
'Everybody’s sorry for something.',
'It’s a worthless bronze medallion, Marion.',
'You going to give it to me?',
'Maybe.',
'I don’t know where it is.',
'Well, maybe you could find it.',
'Three thousand bucks.',
'Well, that will get me back, but not in style.',
'I can get you another two when we get to the States.',
'It’s important, Marion.',
'Trust me.',
'You know the piece I mean?',
'Do you know where it is?',
'Come back tomorrow.',
'Why?',
'Because I said so, that’s why.',
'Ha!',
'See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.',
'Good evening, Fraulein.',
'The bar’s closed.',
'We… We are… not thirsty.',
'What do you want?',
'The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.',
'Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.',
'Must’ve slipped his mind.',
'The man is… nefarious.',
'I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it.',
'Why, are you willing to offer more?',
'Oh, almost certainly.',
'Do you still have it?',
'No.',
'But I know where it is.',
'Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?',
'Your fire is dying here.',
'Why don’t you tell me where the piece is right now?',
'Listen, Herr Mac…',
'I don’t know what kind of people you’re used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place.',
'Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to.',
'Take your hands off me!',
'Take your lousy hands off!',
'Wait a minute.',
'Wait, I… I can be reasonable.',
'That time is passed.',
'You don’t need that.',
'Wait…',
'I’ll tell you everything.',
'Yes, I know you will.',
'Let her go.',
'Whiskey.',
'Shoot them.',
'Shoot them both.',
'My medallion!',
'Well, Jones, at least you haven’t forgotten how to show a lady a good time!',
'Boy, you’re something!',
'Yeah, I’ll tell you what.',
'Until I get back my five thousand dollars, you’re going to get more than you bargained for.',
'I’m your goddamn partner!',
'Cairo, city of the living.',
'A paradise on earth.',
'Silence!',
'Why do you forget yourselves?',
'What is this?',
'Where did this animal come from?',
'Oh… oh, no.',
'Cute.',
'What an adorable creature.',
'Then it shall be welcome in our house.',
'Oh, well, no, you don’t have to keep it here just because of me.',
'I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah.',
'You’re the best digger in Egypt.',
'My services are entirely inconsequential to them.',
'They’ve hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.',
'The excavation is enormous.',
'They hire only strong backs, and they pay pennies for them.',
'It’s as if the pharaohs had returned.',
'When did they find the map room?',
'Three days ago.',
'They have not one brain among them.',
'Except one.',
'He is very clever. He’s a French archeologist.',
'What’s his name?',
'They call him Bellosh.',
'Belloq. Belloq.',
'The Germans have a great advantage over us.',
'They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.',
'Well, they’re not going to find it without this.',
'Who can tell us about these markings?',
'Perhaps a man I know can help us.',
'Indy… there is something that troubles me.',
'What is it?',
'The Ark.',
'If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb.',
'Death has always surrounded it.',
'It is not of this earth.',
'Do we need the monkey, huh?',
'I’m surprised at you, Jones, talking that way about our baby.',
'He’s got your looks too.',
'And your brains.',
'Oops!',
'I noticed that.',
'She’s a smart little thing. Smart.',
'Hey!',
'Hey, where you going?',
'She’ll be all right. Have a date.',
'Come on. Come on.',
'Okay…',
'Marion.',
'What’s this?',
'It’s a date.',
'You eat ‘em.',
'How come you haven’t found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?',
'Who says I haven’t?',
'I do.',
'Dad had you figured a long time ago.',
'He said you were a bum.',
'Oh, he’s being generous.',
'The most gifted bum he ever trained.',
'You know, he loved you like a son.',
'Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.',
'Not much, just you.',
'Marion, get out of here!',
'Duck!',
'Right.',
'Shh! Shh!',
'Marion!',
'Help! Over here, Indy!',
'Get out of the way!',
'Move! Move it!',
'Help me!',
'You can’t do this to me!',
'I’m an American!',
'Indy! Indiana Jones! Help me, Jones!',
'Jones!',
'Marion!',
'Indy!',
'Marion…',
'Dr. Jones.',
'You looking for me?',
'Belloq.',
'Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.',
'I ought to kill you right now.',
'Not a very private place for a murder.',
'Well, these Arabs don’t care if we kill each other.',
'They’re not going to interfere in our business.',
'It was not I who brought the girl into this business.',
'Please, sit down before you fall down.',
'We can at least behave like civilized people.',
'I see your taste in friends remains consistent.',
'How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters.',
'I almost regret it.',
'Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?',
'Try the local sewer.',
'You and I are very much alike.',
'Archeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith.',
'Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.',
'I am a shadowy reflection of you.',
'It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light.',
'Now you’re getting nasty.',
'You know it’s true.',
'How nice.',
'Look at this.',
'It’s worthless.',
'Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.',
'But I take it, I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless… Like the Ark.',
'Men will kill for it.',
'Men like you and me.',
'What about your boss, der Fuhrer?',
'I thought he was waiting to take possession.',
'All in good time.',
'When I am finished with it.',
'Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?',
'It’s a transmitter. It’s a radio for speaking to God.',
'And it’s within my reach.',
'You want to talk to God?',
'Let’s go see Him together. I’ve got nothing better to do.',
'Uncle Indy, come back home now!',
'Next time, Indiana Jones, it’ll take more than children to save you.',
'Uncle Indy!',
'I thought I would find you there.',
'Better than the United States Marines, eh?',
'Marion’s dead.',
'Yes, I know.',
'And me! And me!',
'I’m sorry.',
'Life goes on, Indy.',
'There is the proof.',
'Uh-oh.',
'I have much to tell you.',
'First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man.',
'I can’t figure out how Belloq did it.',
'Where’d he get a copy of the headpiece?',
'There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere.',
'I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:',
'A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher.',
'In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and… and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one.',
'They made their calculations in the map room?',
'This morning.',
'Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.',
'When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp.',
'The Well of the Souls, huh?',
'Come, come, look. Look here… Look.',
'Sit down.',
'Come, sit down.',
'What is it?',
'This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.',
'What about the height of the staff, though?',
'Did Belloq get it off of here?',
'Yes. It is here.',
'This were the old way, this mean six kadam high.',
'About seventy-two inches.',
'Wait!',
'“And take back one kadam to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.”',
'You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.',
'Are you absolutely sure?',
'Belloq’s staff is too long.',
'They’re digging in the wrong place.',
'Ha ha ha!',
'I am the monarch of the sea. I am the ruler of the Qu— 🎵',
'Bad dates.',
'I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.',
'Archeology is not an exact science.',
'It does not deal in time schedules.',
'The Fuhrer is not a patient man.',
'He demands constant reports, and he expects progress.',
'You led me to believe…',
'Nothing! I made no promises.',
'I only said it looked very favorable.',
'Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct.',
'Boy, they’re not kidding, are they?',
'What time does the sun hit the map room?',
'At about nine o’clock in the morning.',
'Not much time, then.',
'Where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?',
'On that ridge… but the map room’s over there.',
'Let’s go, come on.',
'Sallah.',
'Sallah!',
'They’re here.',
'Please, my friend, what is the matter?',
'I fetch the water. I shall get it for you.',
'If you want water, I will get you water.',
'No problem, no problem.',
'I thought you were dead.',
'You must have switched baskets.',
'Are you hurt?',
'No. You have to get me out of here, quick. They’re gonna be back at any minute.',
'Cut me loose. Quick.',
'They keep asking about you. What you know.',
'What’s wrong? Cut me loose.',
'I know where the Ark is, Marion.',
'The Ark’s here?',
'I’m coming with you, Jones. Get me out of here!',
'Cut me loose! You can’t leave me here!',
'If I take you out of here now, they’ll start combing the place for us.',
'Jones, you’ve got to get me out of here!',
'Come on, Jones, are you crazy?',
'Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don’t sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot.',
'I’ll be back to get you.',
'Jones, what’s the matter?',
'That’s it.',
'Who knows?',
'Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.',
'Perhaps there’s some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.',
'Perhaps…',
'Perhaps the girl can help us.',
'My feeling exactly.',
'She was in possession of the original piece for years.',
'She may know much, if properly motivated.',
'I tell you, the girl knows nothing.',
'I’m surprised to find you squeamish.',
'That is not your reputation.',
'But it needn’t concern you.',
'I have the perfect man for this kind of work.',
'Heil Hitler.',
'Indy! Here!',
'We’ve hit stone!',
'Clear it off.',
'Come on, find the edges.',
'Good, good, good.',
'You see, Indy? You see?',
'Okay, bring the pry bars in.',
'As a team, boys! As a team!',
'Push!',
'Get ‘em in there. Get ‘em under.',
'Good, good, that’s it.',
'Watch your toes.',
'Carefully, carefully!',
'Sorry, Indy.',
'Indy… why does the floor move?',
'Give me your torch.',
'Snakes.',
'Why did it have to be snakes?',
'Asps.',
'Very dangerous.',
'You go first.',
'If you’re trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something.',
'I must apologize for their treatment of you.',
'Yeah. Whose idea was it?',
'No food, no water.',
'What kind of people are these friends of yours?',
'At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils.',
'They’re not my friends.',
'However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized.',
'It’s beautiful.',
'I would very much like to see you in it.',
'I’ll bet you would.',
'All right.',
'What do you got to drink around here?',
'We don’t have much time.',
'Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them.',
'Some, uh, piece of information… which I can use to protect you from them.',
'I’ve already told you everything I know.',
'I have no loyalty to Jones.',
'He’s brought me nothing but trouble.',
'Marion, you are beautiful.',
'I don’t think we need a chaperone.',
'Steadily.',
'Steadily. Whoa!',
'Down…',
'Down… Whoa.',
'Carefully, carefully!',
'You all right, Indy?',
'Now gently, boys. Gently, gently!',
'Whoa…',
'I told you it will be all right.',
'Huh…',
'Sallah, get down here!',
'You pour.',
'Oh, that’s good.',
'Whoops.',
'What is this stuff, René?',
'I grew up with this.',
'It’s my family label.',
'Well… I have to be going now, René.',
'I like you, René, very much.',
'Perhaps we’ll meet someday under better circumstances.',
'We meet again, Fréulein.',
'You Americans, you’re all the same.',
'Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.',
'Now… what shall we talk about?',
'All right… take it up!',
'Easy!',
'You’re as stubborn as that girl.',
'You like her too much, I think.',
'Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.',
'You would use a bulldozer to find a… china cup.',
'Colonel! Wake your men!',
'Indy, the torches are burning out.',
'Go on, get out of here.',
'Hyah!',
'Sallah!',
'Hello! Hello!',
'Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?',
'Why don’t you come on down here! I’ll show you!',
'Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here.',
'That’s right, isn’t it?',
'Yes, we are very comfortable up here.',
'So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine.',
'What a fitting end to your life’s pursuits.',
'You’re about to become a permanent addition to this archeological find.',
'Who knows?',
'In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.',
'Son of a bitch.',
'I’m afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones.',
'Our prize is awaited in Berlin.',
'But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.',
'Slimy pig, you let me go!',
'Stop it!',
'Marion!',
'Hang on.',
'Don’t…',
'Indy!',
'Don’t fall!',
'Marion, I got you! I got you! I got you!',
'You traitor! You get your hands off of me!',
'Snakes!',
'Oh, sh… oh, at your feet!',
'The girl was mine!',
'She’s of no use to us.',
'Only our mission for the Fuhrer matters.',
'I wonder sometimes, monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind.',
'It was not to be, chérie.',
'You bastards! I’ll get you for this!',
'Indiana Jones… adieu.',
'No!',
'Take this.',
'Wave it at anything that slithers.',
'Thank you.',
'Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering.',
'Indy!',
'Ow! Jesus!',
'Where did you get this? From him?',
'I was trying to escape.',
'No thanks to you.',
'How hard were you trying?',
'Well, where the hell were you?',
'Watch it, watch it.',
'What are you doing?',
'For the fire!',
'How the hell are we going to get out of here?',
'I’m working on it! I’m working on it!',
'Well, whatever you’re doing, do it faster.',
'Ah…',
'Where are you going?',
'Through that wall.',
'Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me.',
'What do you mean by that?',
'Indy! Damn it! Don’t you leave me down here by myself!',
'Indy!',
'Here we go!',
'Get ready!',
'Indy, the torch is going out!',
'Indy?',
'Marion!',
'Look. Look.',
'They’re going to fly it out of here.',
'When that Ark gets loaded, we’re already going to be on the plane.',
'Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert.',
'To the Ark.',
'When we are very far from here.',
'That will do.',
'Hey, you now… Come here!',
'Come here!',
'Indy!',
'Stay with the Ark! Stay with the Ark!',
'Look out!',
'Oh, my God.',
'Marion.',
'In here! Up here! Indy, come on!',
'Pull on the latch!',
'Move up! It’s gonna blow up!',
'It’s stuck! Indy! I can’t force the lock!',
'Turn it! Turn it! Turn it there!',
'It’s stuck! It’s stuck!',
'Never mind! Get back! Get back!',

'Holy smoke, my friends, I… I’m so pleased you’re not dead!',
'Indy, Indy, we have no time.',
'If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo.',
'Truck?',
'What truck?',
'Let’s go!',
'Get back to Cairo.',
'Get us some transport to England… boat, plane, anything.',
'Meet me at Omar’s. Be ready for me.',
'I’m going after that truck.',
'How?',
'I don’t know.',
'I’m making this up as I go.',
'Ew!',
'He’s there!',
'Idiot! Idiot!',
'Everything at last has been arranged.',
'The Ark? ls on board.',
'Nothing is lacking, now that you’re here.',
'Or what is left of you.',
'You trust these guys?',
'Yes.',
'Mr. Katanga.',
'Mr. Katanga, these are my friends.',
'They are my family.',
'I will hear of it if they are not treated well.',
'My cabin is theirs.',
'Mr. Jones…',
'I’ve heard a lot about you, sir.',
'Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.',
'Good-bye.',
'Look after each other.',
'I am already missing you.',
'You’re my good friend.',

'It’s lovely.',
'Yeah?',
'Yeah…',
'Really?',
'Yeah.',
'What’d you say?',
'Wait… I don’t need any help.',
'You know you do.',
'You’re not the man I knew ten years ago.',

'You are…',
'Please, I don’t need a nurse.',
'I just want to sleep.',
'Don’t be such a baby.',

'What is it?',
'Engines have stopped. I’m going to go check.',
'What’s happening?',
'We have most important friends.',
'Holy shit.',
'I sent my man for you. You and the girl must disappear.',

'What’s the big idea?',
'Let go!!',
'Don’t you touch me.',
'What about Jones?',
'There’s no trace yet, sir.',
'Jones is dead.',
'I killed him.',
'He was of no use to us.',
'This girl, however, has certain value where we’re headed.',
'She’ll bring a very good price.',
'Mmm?',
'Herr Colonel, that cargo you’ve taken…',
'If it’s your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl.',
'It would reduce our loss on this trip.',
'Savage!',
'You are not in the position to ask for anything.',
'We will take what we wish.',
'And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.',
'The girl goes with me.',
'She’ll be part of my compensation.',
'I’m sure your Fuhrer would approve.',
'If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish.',
'I will waste no more time with her now.',

'Good.',
'Take the Ark there immediately.',
'Monsieur…',
'I am uncomfortable with the thought of this… Jewish ritual.',
'Are you sure it’s necessary?',
'Let me ask you this:',
'Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Fuhrer?',
'Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?',
'Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?',
'Hello!',
'Jones.',
'Jones!',

'Your persistence surprises even me.',
'You’re going to give mercenaries a bad name.',

'That depends on how reasonable we’re all willing to be.',
'All I want is the girl.',
'If we refuse?',
'Then your Fuhrer has no prize.',
'Okay, stand back.',
'All of you, stand back.',
'Stand back.',
'Okay, Jones.',

'Blow it up.',
'Yes, blow it up!',
'Blow it back to God.',

'The situation’s totally unacceptable.',
'Well, gentlemen, I guess that just about wraps it up.',
'Where is the Ark?',
'I thought we’d settled that.',
'The Ark is somewhere very safe.',

'Don’t worry, Wu Han, I’ll get you out of here.',
'Not this time, Indy.',
'I followed you on many adventures… but into the great unknown mystery… I go first, Indy.',
'Don’t be sad, Dr. Jones. You will soon be joining him.',

'Listen, I just met you, for Christ’s sakes.',
'Give me…',

'Tight!',
'Slow it down!',
'That wasn’t so bad, was it?',
'Put on the brakes!',
'I hate the water, and I hate being wet, and I hate you!',
'Good. Good!',
'Dr. Jones?',
'I’m all right, Shorty.',
'You okay?',
'Where are we, anyway?',

'How do you know that?',

'Bad news coming.',
'Can you provide us with a guide to take us to Delhi?',
'I’m a professor. I have to get back to my university.',
'Yes. Sajnu will guide you.',
'On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.',
'Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.',
'You will go to Pankot Palace.',
'I thought the palace had been deserted since the 1850s.',
'No. Now there is a new Maharajah, and again the palace has the power of the Dark Light.',
'It is that place kill my people.',
'What has happened here?',
'The evil start in Pankot, then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country, over all country.',
'The evil?',
'What evil?',
'See? Bad news.',
'You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.',
'They came from palace and took Sivalinga from our village.',
'Took what?',
'It’s a stone, a sacred stone from a shrine that protects the village.',
'It is why Siva brought you here.',
'We weren’t brought here.',
'Our plane crashed.',
'It crashed.',
'No, no.',
'We prayed to Siva to help us find the stone.',
'It was Siva who made you fall from the sky.',
'So you will go to Pankot Palace to find Sivalinga and bring back to us.',
'Bring back to us… Bring back to us…',
'Dr. Jones, did they make the plane crash to get you here?',
'No, Shorty, it’s just a ghost story. Don’t worry about it.',
'They took the stone from here.',
'Was the stone very smooth like a… rock from a sacred river?',
'Yes.',
'With three lines across it… representing the three levels of the universe.',
'That’s right.',
'Yes. I’ve seen stones like the one you lost.',
'But why would Maharajah take the sacred stone from here?',
'They says we must pray to their evil god.',
'We says we will not.',
'Excuse me, I don’t understand how one rock could destroy a whole village.',
'He’s saying when the sacred stone was taken, the village wells dried up, and the river turned to sand.',
'The crops were swallowed by the earth, and the animals laid down and turned to dust.',
'Then one night there was a fire in the fields.',
'The men went out to fight the fire.',
'When they came back, the women were crying in the darkness.',
'Children. He says they stole their children.',
'Sankara! Sankara…',
'Ranjit! Ranjit!',
'Sankara.',
'Little boy escaped from the evil palace.',
'Many other children still there.',
'What we do, Dr. Jones?',
'What you think?',
'I think that somebody believes the good-luck rock from this village is one of the lost Sankara Stones.',
'What is Sankara?',
'Fortune and glory, kid.',
'Fortune and glory.',
'Willie, quit monkeying around on that thing.',
'Oh, wait a second! Indy!',
'I can’t go to Delhi like this!',
'We’re not going to Delhi, doll. We’re going to Pankot Palace.',
'Pankot?',
'I can’t go to Pankot! I’m a singer.',
'Oh, I need to call my agent. Is there a phone?',
'Anybody, I need a phone!',
'Oh, quit complaining. This is expensive stuff.',
'You come to America with me and we get job in circus.',
'You like that? You like America?',
'You’re my best friend… You’re my best friend…',
'What big birds!',
'Those aren’t big birds, sweetheart. They’re giant vampire bats.',
'Bats?',
'Oh, pipe down, you big baboon. This doesn’t hurt.',
'You know what you really need? You really need a bath. Oh!',
'Ha ha, very funny! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Very funny! Very funny! All wet!',
'I was happy in Shanghai.',
'I had a little house and a garden.',
'My friends were rich.',
'We went to parties all the time in limousines.',
'I hate being outside!',
'I’m a singer! I could lose my voice!',
'I think we’ll camp here tonight.',
'Cut it out.',
'What do you got?',
'Two sixes.',
'Aha, ha, three aces. I win.',
'Two more game, I have all your money.',
'It’s poker, Shorty, anything can happen.',
'Where did you find your little bodyguard?',
'I didn’t find him, I caught him.',
'What?',
'Shorty’s family were killed when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.',
'He’s been living on the streets since he was four.',
'I caught him trying to pick my pocket, didn’t I, short stuff?',
'Biggest trouble with her is the noise.',
'Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!',
'What do you mean?',
'You take four card.',
'You pay now.',
'Oh, they were stuck together.',
'No stuck. No mistake.',
'They were stuck together.',
'It’s a mistake.',
'I’m very little. You cheat very big.',
'Dr. Jones, you cheat!',
'You pay money. You owe me ten cent.',
'Look at this. Look at this.',
'You accuse me of cheating. You’re cheating.',
'You make me poor. No fun.',
'Play with you no fun.',
'I quit.',
'I quit too.',
'This place is completely surrounded.',
'The entire place is crawling with living things.',
'That’s why they call it the jungle, sweetheart.',
'Oh, my God, what else is out there?',
'Willie, wait…',
'Willie, Willie…',
'What is that? Is that short for something?',
'Willie is my professional name, Indiana.',
'Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.',
'My professional name.',
'Why are you dragging us off to this deserted palace?',
'Fortune and glory?',
'Fortune and glory.',
'Well… this is a piece of an old manuscript.',
'This pictograph represents Sankara, a priest.',
'Scram.',
'Gentle. Gentle. This is hundreds of years old.',
'Is that some kind of writing?',
'Yeah, it’s Sanskrit.',
'Cut it out.',
'It’s part of the legend of Sankara.',
'He climbs Mount Kalisa where he meets Siva, the Hindu god.',
'That’s Siva? And what’s he handing the priest?',
'Rocks.',
'Stop.',
'He told him to go forth and combat evil.',
'And to help him, he gave him five sacred stones with magical properties.',
'Magic rocks?',
'My grandpa was a magician.',
'He spent his entire life with a rabbit in his pocket and pigeons up his sleeves.',
'He made a lot of children happy and died a very poor man.',
'Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.',
'Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.',
'Where are you going?',
'I’d sleep closer, if I were you.',
'For safety’s sake.',
'Dr. Jones, I’d be safer sleeping with a snake.',
'I said, cut it out!',
'I hate that elephant.',
'Indy, look!',
'I see it, Shorty. That’s it. Pankot Palace.',
'Dr. Jones, what you look at?',
'Don’t come up here.',
'No! No, no, no, no! Don’t leave! No!',
'No, no, no, no, no!',
'Oh, baby elephant, stay here!',
'Oh, no! Indy!',
'They’re stealing our rides!',
'We walk from here.',
'Hello.',
'I should say you look rather lost.',
'But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home.',
'We’re not lost. We’re on our way to Delhi.',
'This is Miss Scott.',
'This is Mr. Round.',
'Short Round.',
'My name is Indiana Jones.',
'Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?',
'Hard to believe, isn’t it?',
'I remember first hearing your name when I was up at Oxford.',
'I’m Chattar Lal, Prime Minister to His Highness, the Maharajah of Pankot.',
'I’m enchanted.',
'Enchanted. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.',
'Welcome to Pankot Palace!',
'Enchanted, huh?',
'Shorty, where’s my razor?',
'We are fortunate tonight to have so many unexpected visitors.',
'This is Captain…',
'…Blumburtt.',
'Eleventh Poona Rifles.',
'And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.',
'I am, Captain.',
'Captain Blumburtt and his troops are on a routine inspection tour.',
'The British find it amusing to inspect us at their convenience.',
'I do hope, sir, that it’s not inconvenient to you, sir.',
'The British worry so about their empire.',
'Makes us all feel like well-cared-for children.',
'You look beautiful.',
'I think the Maharajah is swimming in loot.',
'Maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea coming here after all.',
'You look like a princess.',
'Mr. Lal, what do they call the Maharajah’s wife?',
'His Highness has not yet taken a wife.',
'How interesting.',
'Well, maybe it’s because he hasn’t found the right woman.',
'His Supreme Highness, guardian of Pankot tradition, the Maharajah of Pankot, Zalim Singh.',
'That’s the Maharajah?',
'A kid?',
'Maybe he like older women.',
'Captain Blumburtt was just telling me something of the interesting history of the palace, the importance it played in the mutiny.',
'It seems the British never forget the Mutiny of 1857.',
'Yes, well, you know, I think there are other events, before the mutiny, going back a century, back to the time of Clive, that are more interesting.',
'And what events are those, Dr. Jones?',
'Well, if memory serves me correctly, this area, this province, was the center of activity for the Thuggee.',
'Snake… Surprise.',
'What’s the surprise?',
'Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.',
'Yes, of course.',
'The Thuggee was an obscenity that worshiped Kali with human sacrifices.',
'The British Army nicely did away with them.',
'Well, I suppose stories of the Thuggee die hard.',
'There are no stories any more.',
'I’m not so sure.',
'We came from a small village.',
'The peasants there told us Pankot Palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil.',
'Village stories, Dr. Jones.',
'They’re just fear and folklore.',
'You’re beginning to worry Captain Blumburtt.',
'I’m not worried, Mr. Prime Minister, just interested.',
'What? You are not eating?',
'I had bugs for lunch.',
'Give me your hat.',
'Why?',
'‘Cause I’m gonna puke in it.',
'You know, the villagers also told us Pankot Palace had taken something.',
'Dr. Jones, in our country, it’s not usual for a guest to insult his host.',
'I’m sorry.',
'I thought we were talking about folklore.',
'Excuse me, sir, do you have anything simple, like soup?',
'What exactly was it they say was stolen?',
'A sacred rock.',
'You see, Captain, a rock!',
'Something connected the villagers’ rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones.',
'Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors.',
'I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than an archeologist.',
'Well, the newspapers greatly exaggerated the incident.',
'And wasn’t it the Sultan of Madagascar who threatened to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?',
'No, it wasn’t my head.',
'Then your hands, perhaps.',
'No, it wasn’t my hands, it was my…',
'My misunderstanding.',
'Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.',
'I have heard the evil stories of the Thuggee cult.',
'I thought the stories were told to frighten children.',
'Later, I learnt the Thuggee cult was once real and did of unspeakable things.',
'I am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago, and I assure you this will never happen again in my kingdom.',
'If I offended you, then I am sorry.',
'Dessert!',
'Chilled monkey brains.',
'Uh, I think I’ll just… check on Willie.',
'That’s all you better do.',
'Tell me later what happened.',
'Am-scray.',
'I’ve got something for you.',
'There’s nothing you have that I could possibly want.',
'Right.',
'You’re a very nice man.',
'Maybe you could be my palace slave.',
'Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?',
'Yeah.',
'And nothing else.',
'That shock you?',
'Nothing shocks me.',
'I’m a scientist.',
'So, as a scientist, you do a lot of research?',
'Always.',
'And what sort of research would you do on me?',
'Nocturnal activities.',
'You mean like what sort of cream I put on my face at night, what position I like to sleep in?',
'Mating customs.',
'Love rituals?',
'Primitive sexual practices.',
'So you’re an authority in that area?',
'Years of fieldwork.',
'I don’t blame you for being sore at me.',
'I can be hard to handle.',
'I’ve had worse.',
'But you’ll never have better.',
'I don’t know.',
'As a scientist, I don’t want to prejudice my experiment.',
'I’ll let you know in the morning.',
'Why, you conceited ape.',
'I’m not that easy.',
'I’m not that easy either.',
'Trouble with you is, Willie, you’re too used to getting your own way.',
'And you’re just too proud to admit that you’re crazy about me, Dr. Jones.',
'If you want me, Willie… You know where you can find me.',
'Five minutes. You’ll be back over here in five minutes.',
'I’ll be asleep in five minutes.',
'Five. You know it, and I know it.',
'Five minutes.',
'Four and a half.',
'“Palace slave”.',
'“Nocturnal activities”.',
'I’m a “conceited ape”?',
'“I’ll tell you in the morning.”',
'I can’t believe it.',
'He’s not coming.',
'She’s not coming.',
'I can’t believe I’m not going.',
'Indiana Jones!',
'This is one night you’ll never forget!',
'This is the night I slipped right through your fingers!',
'Sleep tight, and pleasant dreams!',
'I could have been your greatest adventure.',
'Dr. Jones, your whip!',
'Shorty, turn off the switch.',
'Indy.',
'Be gentle with me.',
'But I’m here.',
'There’s nobody here.',
'No, I’m here.',
'Indy, you’re acting awfully strange.',
'Hey, I’m right here.',
'“Follow in the footsteps of Siva.”',
'What does that mean?',
'“Do not betray these truths.”',
'Shorty, go get our stuff.',
'Stay behind me, Short Round.',
'Step where I step, and don’t touch anything.',
'I step where you step.',
'I touch nothing.',
'Indy!',
'I step on something.',
'Yeah, there’s something on the ground.',
'Feel like step on fortune cookies.',
'It’s not fortune cookies.',
'Let me take a look.',
'That’s no cookies.',
'It’s all right. I got him.',
'Go. There, go.',
'Stop.',
'Look, just stand up against the wall, will you?',
'You say to stand against the wall!',
'I listen to what you say!',
'Not my fault! Not my fault!',
'Willie, get down here! We’re in trouble!',
'Willie! Willie!',
'Bet I get all dirty again.',
'Willie, get down here!',
'Not my fault!',
'We’re in trouble!',
'Trouble? Trouble? What sort of…',
'This is serious!',
'There are two dead people down here!',
'There’re going to be two dead people in here! Hurry!',
'I’ve almost had enough of you two.',
'Willie!',
'What’s the rush?',
'It’s a long story, Willie. Hurry, or you don’t get to hear it.',
'God, what is this?',
'Indy, what is this?',
'I can’t see a thing!',
'Hurry!',
'All right!',
'I broke a nail.',
'Willie, hurry!',
'They’re in my hair!',
'Shut up, Willie!',
'Indy, let me in!',
'No, let us out!',
'Let me in!',
'Let us out!',
'Shut up!',
'I’m down here!',
'They’re all over me!',
'There’s got to be a fulcrum release lever somewhere.',
'What?',
'A handle that opens the door.',
'Go on!',
'They’re just, just square holes!',
'Go to the right hole.',
'Hurry, Willie!',
'The other one! The other right. Your other right!',
'The one on your right!',
'There’s slime inside!',
'I can’t do it.',
'You can do it. Feel inside.',
'Okay.',
'You feel inside!',
'Do it now!',
'Okay!',
'Willie, we are going to die!',
'It’s soft.',
'It’s moving!',
'Got it!',
'Get ‘em off of me! Get ‘em off of me!',
'They’re all over me! Get ‘em off me!',
'No!',
'It wasn’t me! It’s her!',
'Come on!',
'Go! Move! Come on, move! Come on!',
'It’s a Thuggee ceremony.',
'They’re worshiping Kali.',
'Have you ever seen anything like this before?',
'Nobody’s seen this for a hundred years.',
'Kali Ma… Kali Ma… Kali Ma…!',
'He’s still alive.',
'Kali Ma.',
'That’s the rock they took from the village.',
'It’s one of the Sankara Stones.',
'Why they glow like that?',
'Shh. Shh.',
'The legend says… when the rocks are brought together, the diamonds inside them will glow.',
'Diamonds?',
'Diamonds…',
'Diamonds!',
'Shh.',
'Diamonds.',
'Hey, hey.',
'Look, I want you two to stay up here and keep quiet.',
'Shorty, you keep an eye on her.',
'Why, where are you going?',
'Down there.',
'Down there? Are you crazy?',
'I’m not leaving here without the stones.',
'You could get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!',
'Maybe.',
'But not today.',
'Be careful.',
'Where’s he going?',
'Let me go!',
'Run, Willie! Run!',
'Dr. Jones!',
'I keep telling you, you listen me more, you live longer.',
'Please, let me die.',
'I pray to Siva, “Let me die,” but I do not.',
'Now… Now the evil of Kali take me.',
'How?',
'They will make me drink the blood of the Kali.',
'Then I’ll fall into the Black Sleep of the Kali Ma.',
'What is that?',
'We become like them.',
'We’ll be alive, but like a nightmare.',
'You drink blood, you not wake up from nightmare.',
'You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.',
'There were five stones in the beginning.',
'Over the centuries, they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you.',
'Thieves like me, huh?',
'Still missing two.',
'A century ago, when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.',
'So that’s what you’ve got these slaves digging for, huh?',
'They’re innocent children.',
'They dig for the gems to support our cause.',
'They also search for the last two stones.',
'Soon we will have all the five Sankara Stones, and the Thuggees will be all powerful.',
'What a vivid imagination.',
'You don’t believe me?',
'You will, Dr. Jones.',
'You will become a true believer.',
'Hi.',
'Dr. Jones!',
'Don’t drink, it’s bad! Don’t drink!',
'Spit it out!',
'Dr. Jones…!',
'You dare not do that.',
'Leave him alone, you bastards!',
'The British in India will be slaughtered.',
'Then we will overrun the Muslims.',
'Then the Hebrew God will fall.',
'And then the Christian God will be cast down and forgotten.',
'Soon… Kali Ma will rule the world.',
'Dr. Jones…',
'Kali Ma protects us. We are her children.',
'We pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh…',
'What are you doing?!',
'…and blood.',
'Your friend has seen, and she has heard. Now she will not talk.',
'I’m not going to have anything nice to say about this place when I get back.',
'Indy! For God sakes, help me! What’s the matter with you?',
'No, no.',
'Come. Come.',
'Indiana… Indiana… Help us…',
'Please, snap out of it… You’re not one of them… You’re not one of them…',
'Please come back to us… Don’t leave me…',
'No!',
'What are you doing?',
'Are you mad?',
'This can’t be happening, this can’t be happening.',
'Wake up, Willie, wake up.',
'No! No! No!',
'No, no, no!',
'Wake up, Dr. Jones, wake up!',
'Dr. Jones!',
'Indy, I love you.',
'Wake up, Indy! Wake up!',

'Right. All of us.',
'No!',
'I’ve got to save him!',
'He can take care of himself.',
'He needs me.',
'I’ve got to save Indy!',
'Okay, save him.',
'Drop him down!',
'I kill you! Drop him down!',
'What’s the matter with him?',
'Here. Try this.',
'Go, Indy!',
'It was the Black Sleep of Kali.',
'Short Round!',
'Quit fooling around with that kid! Get down in the cart, now!',
'Okey-dokey, Indy!',
'Please listen. To get out, you must take the left tunnel.',
'Thank you.',
'Shorty! Quit stalling!',
'Come on, Indy!',
'Go!',
'GO! Go!',
'Shorty, look out!',
'Come on!',
'Indy!',
'Hurry!',
'Hurry! Hurry up!',

'No, Indy! You missed it! Left tunnel!',
'We got company!',
'Stop.',

'Let go of the brake.',
'What? What?',
'Let her go.',
'Our only chance is to outrun them.',
'Shorty?',
'Come up here and take the brake.',
'Watch it on the curves, or we’ll fly right off the track.',
'Okay.',

'Yes, Indy.',
'Shortcut!',

'What?',

'No!',

'Oh, God.',
'Come on, let’s go. Strong bridge.',
'Look, strong wood.',
'Come on!',
'Look!',

'Help! I’m falling down.',
'Help!',
'Not very funny.',
'Back!',
'Welcome.',
'Let her go, Mola Ram.',
'You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.',
'Watch your back!',

'Let her go!',
'Drop them, Dr. Jones.',

'Go.',

'Yes, I understand its power now.',

'What for? They’d just put it in a museum.',
'It’d be another rock collecting dust.',
'But then it would’ve given you your fortune and glory.',
'Anything could happen.',
'It’s a long way to Delhi.',
'No, thanks.',

'I’m going home to Missouri, where they never feed you snakes before ripping your heart out and lowering you into hot pits!',

'Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.',
'Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.',
'Have a look over here.',
'This might interest you.',
'Well, it’s sandstone, Christian symbol, early Latin text, mid-twelfth century, I should think.',

'Every man’s dream—including your father’s, I believe.',

'He’s a teacher of medieval literature—the one the students hope they don’t get.',
'Walter. You’re neglecting your guests.',
'Be along in a moment, dear.',
'Hard to resist, isn’t it? The Holy Grail’s final resting place described in detail.',
'What good is it?',
'This Grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.',
'Pretty vague. Where do you want to start looking?',
'Maybe if the tablet were intact, you’d have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.',
'Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.',
'Let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr. Jones.',
'After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years, before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.',
'I’ve heard this one as well.',
'Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it.',
'And before dying of… extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a… to a Franciscan friar, I think.',
'Not “supposedly”, Dr. Jones.',
'This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight’s story.',
'It doesn’t reveal a location of the Grail, I’m afraid. But the knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would.',
'This tablet is one of those markers. It proves the knight’s story is true!',
'But as you pointed out, it’s incomplete.',
'Now, the second marker is entombed with the knight’s dead brother.',
'Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.',
'As you can now see, Dr. Jones… We’re about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago.',
'We’re only one step away.',
'That’s usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.',
'You could be more right than you know.',
'Yes?',
'We’ve hit a snag.',
'Our project leader has vanished, along with all his research.',
'We received a cable from his colleague, Dr. Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what’s become of him.',
'I want you to pick up the trail where he left off.',
'Find the man, and you will find the Grail.',
'You’ve got the wrong Jones, Mr. Donovan.',
'Why don’t you try my father?',
'We already have.',
'Your father is the man who’s disappeared.',
'Your father and I have been friends since time began. I’ve watched you grow up, Indy. I’ve watched the two of you grow apart. I’ve never seen you this concerned about him before.',
'Dad?',
'He’s an academic, a bookworm. He’s not a field man.',
'Dad?! Dad!',
'Dear God.',
'What has the old fool got himself into now?',
'I don’t know, but whatever it is, he’s in over his head.',
'Dad?!',
'It’s today’s mail, and it’s been opened.',
'Mail.',
'That’s it, Marcus.',
'Venice, Italy.',
'What is it?',
'It’s Dad’s Grail diary.',
'Every clue he followed. Every discovery he made.',
'A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail.',
'This is his whole life.',
'Why would he have sent this to me?',
'I don’t know, but someone must want it pretty badly.',
'Do you believe, Marcus?',
'Do you believe the Grail actually exists?',
'The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.',
'But if you want facts, Indy, I’ve none to give you.',
'At my age, I’m prepared to take a few things on faith.',
'Call Donovan, Marcus.',
'Tell him I’ll take that ticket to Venice now.',
'I’ll tell him we’ll take two.',
'All right, tell me what’s going to happen when we get to Venice.',
'Don’t worry, Dr. Schneider will be there to meet you.',
'Schneider?',
'I maintain an apartment in Venice.',
'It’s at your disposal.',
'Oh, well, that’s good. Thank you.',
'Dr. Jones, good luck.',
'Now be very careful. Don’t trust anybody.',
'Signora? Signorina?',
'Ah, Venice…',
'Yes.',
'How will we recognize this Dr. Schneider when we see him?',
'I don’t know. Maybe he’ll know us.',
'Dr. Jones?',
'Yes?',
'I knew it was you.',
'You have your father’s eyes.',
'And my mother’s ears, but the rest belongs to you.',
'Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.',
'Marcus Brody?',
'That’s right.',
'Dr. Elsa Schneider.',
'How do you do?',
'The last time I saw your father, we were in the library.',
'He was very close to tracking down the knight’s tomb.',
'I’ve never seen him so excited.',
'He was as giddy as a schoolboy.',
'Who? Attila the Professor?',
'He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy.',
'Fréulein, will you permit me?',
'I usually don’t.',
'I usually don’t either.',
'In that case, I permit you.',
'It would make me very happy.',
'But I’m already sad. By tomorrow, it will have faded.',
'Tomorrow I’ll steal you another.',
'I hate to interrupt you, but the reason we’re here…',
'Yes. I have something to show you.',
'I left your father working in the library.',
'He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city.',
'When I got back to his table, he’d gone, with all his papers, except for that scrap, which I found near his chair.',
'Roman numerals.',
'Here is the library.',
'That doesn’t look much like a library.',
'Looks like a converted church.',
'In this case, it’s the literal truth.',
'We are on holy ground.',
'These columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.',
'Now, please excuse me.',
'The library’s closing in a few moments.',
'I’ll arrange for us to stay a little longer.',
'Marcus, I’ve seen this window before.',
'Where?',
'Right here, in Dad’s diary.',
'You see?',
'Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.',
'Dad was onto something here.',
'Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don’t know what they mean.',
'Dad sent me this diary for a reason.',
'Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.',
'Find something?',
'Yes. Three, seven and ten.',
'That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.',
'My God, I must be blind.',
'Dad wasn’t looking for a book about the knight’s tomb, he was looking for the tomb itself.',
'Don’t you get it?',
'The tomb is somewhere in the library.',
'You said yourself it used to be a church.',
'Look.',
'Three… Three.',
'Seven… Seven.',
'Ten… And ten. Now where’s the ten?',
'Look around for the ten.',
'Three and seven.',
'Seven and seven and ten.',
'Ten.',
'“X” marks the spot.',
'Bingo.',
'You don’t disappoint, Dr. Jones.',
'You’re a great deal like your father.',
'Except he’s lost, and I’m not.',
'Lower me down.',
'Look after this for me, will you?',
'Come on.',
'Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.',
'Right.',
'Six hundred years before the Crusades.',
'The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.',
'That’s right.',
'If there’s a knight of the First Crusade down here, that’s where we’ll find him.',
'What’s this one?',
'The Ark of the Covenant.',
'Are you sure?',
'Pretty sure.',
'Watch out.',
'It’s petroleum.',
'I should sink a well down here and retire.',
'Give me the lighter.',
'Oh, rats.',
'Come on.',
'Come here.',
'Look, it… it must be one of these.',
'Look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork.',
'It’s this one.',
'This is it. We found it.',
'Look.',
'The engraving on the shield, it’s the same as on the Grail tablet.',
'The shield is the second marker.',
'What’s that?',
'It’s a rubbing Dad made of the Grail tablet.',
'Just like your father, giddy as a schoolboy.',
'Wouldn’t it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?',
'He never would have made it past the rats.',
'He hates rats.',
'He’s scared to death of them.',
'Get back! Back against the wall.',
'Quick! Under it! Air pocket!',
'Don’t wander off.',
'What?! What?!',
'I think I’ve found a way out.',
'Deep breath.',
'Ah, Venice.',
'Are you crazy? Don’t go between them!',
'Go between them? Are you crazy?',
'I said go around!',
'You said go between them!',
'I said, don’t go between them!',
'No!',
'Why are you trying to kill us?',
'Because you’re looking for the Holy Grail.',
'My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?',
'No.',
'Where is he?',
'Talk or you’re dead.',
'Damn it, tell me!',
'Tell me!',
'If you don’t let go, Dr. Jones, we’ll both die.',
'Then we’ll die.',
'My soul is prepared. How’s yours?',
'This is your last chance.',
'No, Dr. Jones, it’s yours.',
'All right, where’s my father?',
'If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.',
'Who are you?',
'My name is Kazim.',
'And why were you trying to kill me?',
'The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years, and for all that time, the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.',
'Let me off at this jetty.',
'Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ?',
'Is it for His glory, or for yours?',
'I didn’t come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.',
'In that case, God be with you in your quest.',
'Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald, on the Austrian-German border.',
'How’s the head?',
'It’s better, now I’ve seen this.',
'It’s the name of a city. Alexandretta?',
'The knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year.',
'The entire city was destroyed.',
'The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins.',
'Marcus, you remember what the Grail tablet said, “Across the desert and through the mountain, to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.”',
'But where exactly?',
'Your father would know.',
'Your father did know. Look. He made a map.',
'He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail quest.',
'A map with no names.',
'Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here.',
'He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains, here.',
'Straight to the canyon.',
'He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.',
'Alexandretta.',
'Now we know.',
'Yes. Now we know.',
'Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.',
'What about you?',
'I’m going after Dad.',
'Elsa?',
'Elsa? Elsa?',
'My room…',
'Mine too.',
'What were they looking for?',
'This.',
'The Grail diary?',
'Uh-huh.',
'You had it?',
'You didn’t trust me.',
'I didn’t know you.',
'At least I let you tag along.',
'Oh, yes.',
'Give them a flower, and they’ll follow you anywhere.',
'Knock it off. You’re not mad.',
'No?',
'No. You like the way I do things.',
'It’s lucky I don’t do things the same way.',
'You’d still be standing at the Venice pier!',
'Look, what do you think is going on here?',
'Since I met you, I’ve nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait.',
'We’re caught in the middle of something sinister here.',
'My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for.',
'And until I’m sure, I’m going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.',
'How dare you kiss me!',

'And I hate arrogant men.',
'Ah, Venice.',
'What do you know about this place?',
'I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.',
'What are you going to do?',
'Don’t know. I’ll think of something.',
'Yes?',
'And not before time!',
'Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day?',
'We’re drenched!',
'Now look, I’ve gone and caught a sniffle.',
'Are you expected?',
'Do not take that tone with me, my good man.',
'Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.',
'Tapestries?',
'Dear me, the man is dense.',
'This is a castle, isn’t it? There are tapestries?',
'This is a castle, and we have many tapestries.',
'But if you are a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse!',
'How dare he?',
'Nazis. I hate these guys.',
'This one. I think he’s in here.',
'How do you know?',
'Because it’s wired.',
'Indy? Indy?',
'Don’t worry. This is kid’s play.',
'I’ll be right back.',
'Junior?',
'Yes, sir.',
'It is you, Junior!',
'Don’t call me that, please.',
'Well, what are you doing here?',
'I came to get you. What do you thi—',
'Late fourteenth century, Ming dynasty.',
'It breaks the heart.',
'And the head. You hit me, Dad.',
'I’ll never forgive myself.',
'Don’t worry, I’m fine.',
'Thank God.',
'It’s fake.',
'See, you can tell by the cross section.',
'No!',
'Dad, get your stuff. We’ve got to get out of here.',
'Well, I’m sorry about your head, though, but I thought you were one of them.',
'Dad, they come in through the doors.',
'Good point.',
'But better safe than sorry.',
'So I was wrong this time.',
'But, by God, I wasn’t wrong when I mailed you my diary.',
'You obviously got it.',
'I got it, and I used it.',
'We found the entrance to the catacombs.',
'Through the library?',
'Right.',
'I knew it.',
'And the tomb of Sir Richard?',
'Found it.',
'He was actually there?',
'You saw him?',
'Well, what was left of him.',
'And his shield, the inscription on Sir Richard’s shield?',
'Alexandretta.',
'Alexandretta! Of course!',
'On the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire.',
'Junior, you did it.',
'No, Dad. You did.',
'Forty years.',
'If only I could have been with you.',
'There were rats, Dad.',
'Rats?',
'Yeah, big ones.',
'What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?',
'They wanted my diary.',
'Yeah?',
'I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.',
'Yeah.',
'Dr. Jones.',
'Yes?',
'I will take the book now.',
'What book?',
'You have the diary in your pocket.',
'You dolt!',
'Do you think my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here?',
'You didn’t, did you?',
'You didn’t bring it, did you?',
'Well…',
'You did.',
'Look, can we discuss this later?',
'I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.',
'Will you take it easy?',
'Take it easy?',
'Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?',
'So it wouldn’t fall into their hands!',
'I came here to save you!',
'Oh, yeah?',
'And who’s gonna come to save you, Junior?',
'I told you…',
'…don’t call me Junior!',
'Look what you did!',
'I can’t believe what you did…',
'Elsa? Elsa?',
'That’s far enough. Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.',
'Put down the gun, or the Fréulein dies.',
'But she’s one of them.',
'Indy, please!',
'She’s a Nazi.',
'What?',
'Trust me.',
'Indy, no!',
'I will kill her!',
'Yeah? Go ahead!',
'No! Don’t shoot!',
'Don’t worry. He won’t.',
'Indy, please! Do what he says!',
'And don’t listen to her.',
'Enough! She dies!',
'Wait! Wait…',
'I’m sorry.',
'No, don’t be.',
'But you should have listened to your father.',
'She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it.',
'How did you know she was a Nazi?',
'Hmm?',
'How did you know she was a Nazi?',
'She talks in her sleep.',
'I didn’t trust her. Why did you?',
'Because he didn’t take my advice.',
'Donovan.',
'Didn’t I warn you not to trust anybody, Dr. Jones?',
'I misjudged you, Walter.',
'I knew you would sell your mother for an Etruscan vase, but I didn’t know you would sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.',
'Dr. Schneider, there are pages torn out of this.',
'This book contained a map, a map with no names, precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.',
'So it did.',
'Where are these missing pages, this map?',
'We must have these pages back.',
'You’re wasting your breath.',
'He won’t tell us, and he doesn’t have to.',
'It’s perfectly obvious where the pages are.',
'He’s given them to Marcus Brody.',
'Marcus?',
'You didn’t drag poor Marcus along, did you?',
'He’s not up to the challenge.',
'He sticks out like a sore thumb.',
'We’ll find him.',
'The hell you will.',
'He’s got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs.',
'Brody’s got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan.',
'He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom.',
'He’ll blend in, disappear.',
'You’ll never see him again.',
'With any luck, he’s got the Grail already.',
'Does anyone here speak English?',
'Or even ancient Greek?',
'Water? No, thank you, sir.',
'No. Fish make love in it.',
'Goodness me. Thank you so much. No, I don’t like that.',
'No, I really don’t want…',
'No, no, thank you very much.',
'No, thank you, madam. I’m a vegetarian.',
'Does anyone understand a word I’m saying here?',
'Mr. Brody!',
'Sallah. What a relief.',
'Marcus Brody, sir.',
'But where is Indy?',
'He’s in Austria.',
'A slight detour.',
'You are on your own?',
'Yes, but don’t panic. Everything’s under control.',
'Have you, have you arranged our supplies?',
'Yes, of course. But where are we going?',
'This map will show you.',
'It was drawn by…',
'Mr. Brody.',
'Welcome to Iskenderun.',
'The director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.',
'Well, your servant, sir.',
'And I am his.',
'Follow me, please.',
'My reputation precedes me.',
'There is no museum in Iskenderun.',
'Papers, please.',
'Papers? Of course. (Run.)',
'Yes.',
'Papers. Got it here. Just finished reading it myself. (Run.)',
'Uh, yes.',
'Egyptian Mail, morning edition. (Run!)',
'Did you say…',
'Run!',
'Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!',
'Find the back door! Find the back door!',
'Intolerable.',
'Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.',
'You must return immediately.',
'A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.',
'So?',
'Your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level.',
'Thank you, Herr Oberst. I will meet you at Iskenderun.',
'Take this diary to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.',
'It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule.',
'Without the map, I’m afraid it’s no better than a souvenir.',
'Let me kill them now.',
'No.',
'If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we’ll need them alive.',
'Always do what the doctor orders.',
'Don’t look at me like that.',
'We both wanted the Grail.',
'I would have done anything to get it.',
'You would have done the same.',
'I’m sorry you think so.',
'I can’t forget how wonderful it was.',
'Thank you.',
'It was rather wonderful.',
'Dr. Schneider.',
'Your car is waiting.',
'That’s how Austrians say good-bye.',
'And this is how we say good-bye in Germany, Dr. Jones.',
'I liked the Austrian way better.',
'So did I.',
'Let’s try and get these ropes loose.',
'We’ve got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do.',
'You said he had two days’ start. That he would blend in. Disappear.',
'Are you kidding? I made that up.',
'You know Marcus. He got lost once in his own museum.',
'Can you try and reach my left jacket pocket?',
'What am I looking for?',
'My lucky charm.',
'Feels like a cigarette lighter.',
'Try and burn through the ropes.',
'Very good.',
'I ought to tell you something.',
'Don’t get sentimental now, Dad. Save it till we get out of here.',
'The floor’s on fire.',
'See?',
'What?',
'And the chair.',
'Move! Move it out of here! Go!',
'It’s scorching the table! Fast!',
'Move!',
'Okay!',
'Well, we have Marcus Brody, but more important, we have the map.',
'“By the personal command of the Fuhrer.',
'“Secrecy essential to success.',
'“Eliminate the American conspirators.”',
'Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.',
'Dad!',
'What?',
'Head for the fireplace!',
'I think I can get these ropes off.',
'Whoops!',
'Our situation has not improved.',
'Listen, Dad, I’m almost free.',
'Alarm!',
'This is intolerable.',
'I’m out, Dad.',
'Well done, boy.',
'Come on, Dad.',
'Dead end.',
'There’s got to be a…',
'A secret door or a…',
'Passageway or something.',
'I find that if I just sit down and think…',
'Dad!',
'…The solution presents itself.',
'Great. More boats.',
'You say this has been just another typical day for you, huh?',
'No! But better than most.',
'Come on, Dad. Come on.',
'What about the boat?',
'We’re not going on the boat?',
'Jones!',
'Halt! Halt!',
'Stop!',
'What?',
'Stop! Stop!',
'You’re going the wrong way. We have to get to Berlin.',
'Brody’s this way.',
'My diary’s in Berlin.',
'We don’t need the diary, Dad.',
'Marcus has the map.',
'There is more in the diary than just the map.',
'All right, Dad. Tell me.',
'Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.',
'What final challenge?',
'Three devices of such lethal cunning.',
'Booby traps?',
'Oh, yes.',
'But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.',
'Well, what are they?',
'Can’t you remember?',
'I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn’t have to remember.',
'Half the German army’s on our tail, and you want me to go to Berlin?',
'Into the lion’s den?',
'Yes.',
'The only thing that matters is the Grail.',
'What about Marcus?',
'Marcus would agree with me.',
'Two selfless martyrs.',
'Jesus Christ.',
'That’s for blasphemy.',
'The quest for the Grail is not archeology.',
'It’s a race against evil.',
'If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth.',
'Do you understand me?',
'This is an obsession, Dad.',
'I never understood it. Never.',
'Neither did Mom.',
'Oh, yes, she did.',
'Only too well.',
'Unfortunately, she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.',
'My boy, we are pilgrims in an unholy land.',
'Fréulein Doctor.',
'Where is it?',
'How did you get here?',
'Where is it? I want it.',
'You came back for the book? Why?',
'My father didn’t want it incinerated.',
'Is that what you think of me?',
'I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.',
'But you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the Grail stands for.',
'Who gives a damn what you think?',
'You do.',
'All I have to do is squeeze.',
'All I have to do is scream.',
'I’ve got it. Let’s get the hell out of here.',
'What did you get?',
'I don’t know. First available flight out of Germany.',
'Good.',
'Well, we made it.',
'When we’re airborne, with Germany behind us, then I’ll share that sentiment.',
'Relax.',
'Tickets, please…',
'Guten Tag, Herr Jones.',
'Tickets, please.',
'No ticket.',
'Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!',
'You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.',
'That’s not all we shared.',
'It’s disgraceful. You’re old enough to be her fa…',
'Her grandfather.',
'Well, I’m as human as the next man.',
'I was the next man.',
'Of course. Well…',
'Ships that pass in the night.',
'Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink?',
'I had a milkshake.',
'What did we talk about?',
'We didn’t talk.',
'We never talked.',
'Do I detect a rebuke?',
'A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.',
'It was a lonely way to grow up. For you too.',
'If you’d been an ordinary, average father, like the other guys’ dads, you’d have understood that.',
'Actually, I was a wonderful father.',
'When?',
'Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?',
'Wash your ears? Do your homework?',
'No. I respected your privacy, and I taught you self-reliance.',
'What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who’d been dead for five hundred years in another country.',
'And I learned it so well that we’ve hardly spoken for twenty years.',
'You left just when you were becoming interesting.',
'Unbelievable.',
'Dad, how can you…',
'Very well.',
'I’m here now.',
'What do you want to talk about?',
'Well, I…',
'I can’t think of anything.',
'Then what are you complaining about?',
'Look, we have work to do.',
'When we get to Alexandretta, we will face three challenges.',
'The first, “The Breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass.”',
'Second, “The Word of God.',
'“Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed.”',
'Third, “The Path of God.',
'“Only in the leap from the lion’s head will he prove his worth.”',
'What does that mean?',
'I don’t know. We’ll find out.',
'We’re turning around.',
'They’re taking us back to Germany.',
'Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead.',
'Come on, Dad. Move!',
'Come on, Dad. Come on!',
'I didn’t know you could fly a plane.',
'Fly, yes.',
'Land, no.',
'Dad, you’re going to have to use the machine gun.',
'Get it ready.',
'Eleven o’clock!',
'Dad, eleven o’clock!',
'What happens at eleven o’clock?',
'Twelve, eleven, ten.',
'Eleven o’clock, fire!',
'Dad, are we hit?',
'More or less.',
'Son, I’m sorry.',
'They got us.',
'Hang on, Dad. We’re going in!',
'Nice landing.',
'Thanks.',
'Those people are trying to kill us!',
'I know, Dad!',
'Well. It’s a new experience for me.',
'It happens to me all the time.',
'This is intolerable!',
'This could be close.',
'Faster, boy! Faster!',
'Well, they don’t come any closer than that!',
'Dad, he’s coming back!',
'I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.',
'“Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky.”',
'These pages are taken from Professor Jones’ diary, Your Highness, and they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail.',
'As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands.',
'However, Your Highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable compensation.',
'What have you brought?',
'Precious valuables, Your Highness, donated by some of the finest families in all of Germany.',
'Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.',
'Four-point-three liter, thirty horsepower, six-cylinder engine, with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.',
'Can go from zero to a hundred kilometers an hour in twelve-point-five seconds.',
'And I even like the color.',
'The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.',
'You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehicles and tanks.',
'You’re welcome.',
'We have no time to lose.',
'Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.',
'We go this way.',
'Get that camel out of the way.',
'What happened to Marcus, Sallah?',
'They set out across the desert this afternoon.',
'I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.',
'Now they have the map.',
'And in this sort of race, there’s no silver medal for finishing second.',
'Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?',
'I’d rather spit in your face.',
'But as I haven’t got any spit…',
'Must be within three or four miles.',
'Otherwise we are off the map.',
'Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.',
'You’re meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.',
'I see Brody.',
'He seems okay.',
'They’ve got a tank.',
'Six-pound gun.',
'What do you think you’re doing there? Get down!',
'Dad, we’re well out of range.',
'That car belonged to my brother-in-law.',
'Come on, come on!',
'I can’t see anyone up there.',
'Maybe it wasn’t even Jones.',
'No, it is him, all right.',
'He’s here somewhere.',
'Put Brody in the tank.',
'Well, in this sun, without transportation, they’re as good as dead.',
'It’s Jones, all right.',
'Now, who are all these people?',
'Who cares?',
'As long as they’re keeping Donovan busy.',
'Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.',
'I’m going after those horses.',
'I’ll take the camels.',
'I don’t need camels.',
'But, Indy…',
'No camels.',
'Who is he?',
'A messenger from God.',
'For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation.',
'Marcus!',
'“Genius of the restoration…”',
'“Aid our own resuscitation.”',
'Henry, what are you doing here?',
'It’s a rescue, old boy. Come on.',
'Search him.',
'What is in this book?',
'That miserable little diary of yours.',
'We have the map. The book is useless.',
'And yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it.',
'Why?',
'What are you hiding?',
'What does the diary tell you that it doesn’t tell us?',
'It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them.',
'Colonel!',
'Jones is getting away.',
'I think not, Herr Donovan.',
'Not that Jones, the other Jones!',
'Sallah, I said no camels! That’s five camels! Can’t you count?',
'Compensation for my brother-in-law’s car.',

'Give me your hand!',
'Junior!',
'Indy!',
'Oh, God.',

'And I never told him anything.',
'I just wasn’t ready, Marcus.',
'Five minutes would have been enough.',
'I thought I’d lost you, boy!',
'I thought you had too, sir.',
'Well…',
'Well done. Come on.',
'Let’s go, then.',
'Why are you sitting there resting when we’re so near the end?',
'Come on, let’s go!',

'Helmut, another volunteer!',
'I never expected to see you again.',
'I’m like a bad penny, I always turn up.',
'Step back now, Dr. Schneider. Give Dr. Jones some room.',
'He’s going to recover the Grail for us.',
'Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?',
'As what? A Nazi stooge like you?',
'The Nazis?',
'Is that the limit of your vision?',
'The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend, take on the world.',
'Well, they’re welcome.',
'But I want the Grail itself.',
'The cup that gives everlasting life.',
'Hitler can have the world, but he can’t take it with him.',
'I’m going to be drinking my own health when he’s gone the way of the dodo.',

'Dad? Dad?!',
'Junior…',
'No—!',

'That was seven hundred years ago.',

'You’re strangely dressed, for a knight.',
'I’m not exactly…',
'A knight? What do you mean?',
'I was chosen because I was the bravest, the most worthy.',
'The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat.',
'I pass it to you who vanquished me.',
'Listen, I don’t have time to explain, but—',
'Which one is it?',
'You must choose. But choose wisely.',
'For as the true Grail will bring you life, the false Grail will take it from you.',
'I’m not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?',
'Let me choose.',
'Thank you, Doctor.',
'Oh, yes.',
'It’s more beautiful than I’d ever imagined.',
'This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.',
'Eternal life.',
'What is happening to me?',
'Tell me, what is happening?',
'He chose poorly.',
'It would not be made out of gold.',
'That’s the cup of a carpenter.',
'There’s only one way to find out.',
'You have chosen wisely.',

'Well, what can I say, Jonesy?',

'Dr. Jones, let’s just say for now that you are of interest to the Bureau.',
'Of great interest.',
'…Grooved Ware in the beginning of modern drainage practices, which we also see in Skara Brae on the west coast of Scotland.',
'Skara Brae dates from 3100 BC and was continuously occupied for six hundred years until it was apparently abandoned in 2500 BC.',

'The university isn’t gonna get itself embroiled in that kind of controversy, not in this charged climate.',
'So you’re firing me.',
'A leave of absence is all. An indefinite leave of absence.',
'You are firing me.',

'Please don’t be foolish.',
'You don’t know what I had to go through to get that for you.',
'You went through? What exactly did you have to go through, Charlie?',
'Henry…',
'I resigned.',
'Where will you go?',
'Train to New York, overnight to London, for starts.',
'I might end up teaching in Leipzig. Heinrich owes me a favor.',

'Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?',
'First Dad, then Marcus.',
'We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things… and starts taking them away.',
'Just another half glass.',
'Hey!',
'Hey, old man!',
'Professor, hello! Hey! Are you Dr. Jones?',
'You’re running out of platform, kid.',
'Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley’s?',
'Harold Oxley? The archeologist?',
'Yeah.',
'What about him?',
'They’re going to kill him.',
'I haven’t talked to Harold Oxley in twenty years.',
'He’s a brilliant guy.',
'He could put you to sleep just by talking.',
'Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid, that’s how I did get to sleep.',
'Oxley’s voice was better than a glass of warm milk, you know.',
'The name’s Mutt, Mutt Williams.',
'Mutt? What kind of name is that?',
'Yeah.',
'It’s the one I picked. You got a problem with it?',
'Take it easy. What was your relationship to Oxley?',
'My dad died in the war. Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.',
'You were saying somebody’s going to kill him?',
'Six months ago, my mom gets a letter from the Ox.',
'He’s down in Peru.',
'Found some type of skull, a crystal skull.',
'Like the one that guy Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?',
'The one he found.',
'Nice jacket.',
'The Ox and I were obsessed with the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.',
'How do you know about it?',
'Are you kidding? It’s all he talked about.',
'He’d talk about that thing till the cows come home.',
'What’s it? It’s like an idol?',
'Deity carving. Mesoamerican.',
'There are a number of crystal skulls in the world.',
'I saw one in the British Museum.',
'Interesting craftsmanship, but that’s about it.',
'All right, well, laugh if you want. Oxley said he found it this time.',
'He said this was real and he was off to a place called Akator with it.',
'Akator? He said that? You’re sure?',
'Yeah.',
'That’s what he said. He said Akator. What is it?',
'It’s a mythical lost city in the Amazon.',
'Conquistadors called it El Dorado.',
'Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were chosen by the gods seven thousand years ago to build a giant city out of solid gold.',
'It had aqueducts and paved roads and technology that wouldn’t be seen again for five thousand years.',
'Francisco de Orellana disappeared into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.',
'I almost died of typhus looking for it myself.',
'I don’t think it exists.',
'Why would Ox want to take the skull there?',
'The legend says that a crystal skull was stolen from Akator in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and that whoever returns the skull to the city temple will be given control over its power.',
'Power. Right. So there’s some kind of power. What’s the power?',
'I don’t know, kid. It’s just a story.',
'No.',
'From his letter, my mom thought the Ox was off his rocker.',
'You know, smog in the noggin, so she goes down there to find him, only he’d already been kidnapped.',
'Now they’ve got her too.',
'Now, Ox said he hid that skull someplace, and if my mom doesn’t come up with it, they’re gonna kill them both.',
'Now, she said you’d help me.',
'Me? What’s your mom’s name again?',
'Mary. Mary Williams. You remember her?',
'There were a lot of Marys, kid.',
'Shut up! That’s my mother you’re talking about!',
'All right? That’s my mother.',
'You don’t have to get sore all the time just to prove how tough you are.',
'Sit down. Please. Sit down.',
'She said if anybody could find the skull, it’s you.',
'Like you’re some type of… Like a grave robber or something.',
'I’m a tenured professor of archeology.',
'Oh, you’re a teacher. Well, that’s gonna be a big help.',
'Anyway, she called me two weeks ago from South America.',
'Said she’d escaped, but they were after her.',
'She said she’d just gotten a letter from the Ox and mailed it to me so I could give it to you.',
'Then the line went dead. I opened it.',
'I mean, the thing’s pointless, though. It’s just gibberish.',
'It’s not even English lettering.',
'See?',
'See those two bricks over there, at the counter?',
'I don’t think they’re here for the milkshakes.',
'Who are they?',
'Don’t know. Maybe FBI.',
'Come quietly, Dr. Jones.',
'Make that KGB.',
'And bring letter with you.',
'Letter? What letter?',
'Letter Mr. Williams just give you.',
'Me? Do I look like a mailman?',
'We don’t ask again. Come now or we’ll…',
'Or what?',
'Nice try, kid, but I think you just brought a knife to a gunfight.',
'Outside now.',
'Hit this guy.',
'Who?',
'Joe College. Hit him hard.',
'Here, hold this.',
'What?',
'That’s my boyfriend!',
'Take it outside!',
'Get that greaser!',
'Your mom didn’t escape.',
'They let her go, so she could mail the letter, and you could bring it to me, and I could translate it!',
'Get on, gramps!',
'Go, go, go, go, go!',
'Better dead than Red! Better dead than Red!',
'This is crazy! Somebody’s going to get hurt!',
'Left! Go left! Left!',
'Move, move! Move!',
'Split, split! Split, split!',
'You’re going too fast.',
'That’s a matter of opinion!',
'Excuse me, Dr. Jones.',
'Yes?',
'I just had a question on Hargrove’s normative culture model.',
'Forget Hargrove.',
'Read Vere Gordon Childe on diffusionism.',
'He spent most of his life in the field.',
'If you want to be a good archeologist, you got to get out of the library!',
'Who is that?',
'Francisco de Orellana, the conquistador.',
'Remember, the guy who got lost looking for the skull.',
'And just as I thought.',
'Koihoma.',
'What’s that?',
'It’s an extinct Latin American language. Pre-Columbian syllabic base.',
'See. Diagonal stresses on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.',
'You speak it?',
'Nobody speaks it.',
'It hasn’t been heard aloud in three thousand years.',
'I might be able to read a bit though if I walk it through Mayan first.',
'You know, for an old man, you ain’t bad in a fight.',
'Thanks a lot.',
'What are you, like, eighty?',
'It’s a riddle.',
'Leave it to Ox to write a riddle in a dead language.',
'“Follow the lines in the earth only gods can read, which lead to Orellana’s cradle guarded by the living dead.”',
'He’s talking about the Nazca Lines.',
'What are those?',
'Hold on here.',
'Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings carved into the desert floor in Peru.',
'From the ground, they don’t look like anything.',
'But from the sky, only the gods can read them, because only gods live up there.',
'Oxley’s telling us the skull is in Nazca, Peru.',
'Finally. They saw him.',
'Ox wandered into town a couple of months ago, raving like a madman.',
'Police locked him up in the sanitarium. It’s this way.',
'I took Spanish and I didn’t understand a word of that. What was it?',
'Quechua, local Incan dialect.',
'Where’d you learn that one?',
'Long story.',
'I got time.',
'I rode with Pancho Villa. A couple of his guys spoke it.',
'Bullshit!',
'You asked.',
'Pancho Villa?',
'Technically I was kidnapped.',
'By Pancho Villa?',
'It was the fight against Victoriano Huerta.',
'How old were you?',
'About your age.',
'Your parents must’ve had a cow, huh?',
'It worked out. Things were a little tense at home.',
'Yeah, me and my mom aren’t on the best of terms either.',
'Treat her right, kid. You only get one, and sometimes not for that long.',
'It’s not my fault. It’s hers.',
'She just got P.O.’ed because I quit school.',
'She thinks I’m some kind of goof or something.',
'You quit school?',
'Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.',
'Fancy prep schools that teach you how to debate and chess and fencing.',
'I’m great with the blade. I just think it’s a waste of time.',
'You never finished.',
'No.',
'Just a bunch of useless skills. Wrong books.',
'‘Cause I love reading. Me and Ox used to read all the time.',
'But now I can pick them myself. You get me?',
'What do you do for money?',
'Fix motorcycles.',
'Gonna do that for the rest of your life?',
'Maybe I will, Teach. You got a problem with that?',
'No. Not if that’s what you love doing.',
'Don’t let anybody tell you different.',
'This is it. Sister.',
'She says Ox isn’t here. She doesn’t know where he is.',
'Some men came and took him away, men with guns.',
'She says he was obsessed, deranged.',
'Drew pictures all over the walls of his cell.',
'This riddle in Oxley’s letter doesn’t make any sense.',
'“Follow the lines that only the gods can read that lead to Orellana’s cradle.”',
'Cradle, cradle, birth.',
'Orellana wasn’t born in Peru. He was born in Spain.',
'He was a conquistador. He came here for the gold.',
'What happened to him?',
'He disappeared along with six others. Their bodies were never found.',
'He must have lost his mind.',
'Ox, man, what happened? What happened?',
'This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.',
'Look at the elongated cranium.',
'And the same word in different languages, over and over again.',
'Return.',
'Return where?',
'Or return what?',
'You mean the skull?',
'Seems to have been on his mind.',
'Where was he supposed to return it to?',
'Sweep.',
'Yeah.',
'Ox didn’t mean Orellana’s birthplace.',
'“Cradle” has another meaning in Mayan.',
'Literally, it means “resting place”, as in final resting place.',
'Ox meant Orellana’s grave.',
'This drawing scratched into the floor is the cemetery where he’s buried.',
'You said Orellana vanished and nobody ever found his grave.',
'Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.',
'“Grave robbers will be shot.”',
'Good thing we’re not grave robbers.',
'What are we looking for?',
'I don’t know yet.',
'Maybe an antechamber off one of these barrows.',
'I think I just saw something!',
'Oh, you’re jumping at shadows.',
'This way down.',
'This way up.',
'Yeah.',
'Those darts are poison!',
'Stay there.',
'You’re a teacher?',
'Part-time.',
'Dead end.',
'Maybe.',
'What are you doing? Put that thing away.',
'Give me some light over here.',
'Bring it over here.',
'It’s just a thing.',
'Dance on your own dime, will you?',
'One of the scorpions just stung me! Am I gonna die?',
'How big?',
'Huge!',
'Good.',
'Good?',
'When it comes to scorpions, the bigger the better.',
'A small one bites you, don’t keep it to yourself.',
'Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.',
'Like the drawings in Oxley’s cell. Means we’re getting closer.',
'That’s crazy. Why is it like that?',
'Nazca Indians used to bind their infants’ heads with rope to elongate the skull like that.',
'Why?',
'Honor the gods.',
'No, no. God’s head is not like that, man.',
'Depends on who your god is.',
'You’re going nowhere fast.',
'Professor, this really is a dead end. Look.',
'Hey!',
'Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.',
'This is incredible.',
'Unreal.',
'Don’t touch anything.',
'Footprints. Somebody’s been here.',
'Recently.',
'Two sets of prints.',
'Same size, could have been the same person twice.',
'Not bad, kid.',
'One. Two.',
'Three. Four. Five. Six.',
'Seven.',
'Orellana and his men might’ve made it out of the jungle after all.',
'Give me some light.',
'You don’t have a knife, do you?',
'Looks like he just died yesterday.',
'It’s the wrappings. They preserved him.',
'What just happened?',
'He’s been wrapped up for five hundred years. Air doesn’t agree with him.',
'Thanks.',
'I don’t want to keep borrowing yours all the time.',
'That’s fine.',
'I was going to put it back.',
'Is this one open already?',
'It’s him.',
'It’s Orellana himself.',
'They called him The Gilded Man. His lust for gold was legendary.',
'It’s odd.',
'Somebody’s been here and gone.',
'But they left all this gold and all the artifacts.',
'What were they looking for?',
'Hold this.',
'No. No.',
'Unbelievable.',
'No tool marks.',
'A single piece of seamless quartz.',
'Cut across the grain.',
'It’s not possible, even with today’s technology, it would shatter.',
'Crystal’s not magnetic.',
'Neither is gold.',
'What is this thing?',
'Maybe the Nazca Indians thought this was their god.',
'You think this is the one from…',
'From Akator.',
'Maybe the Spaniards found this skull along with all this other loot.',
'They were headed for their ships along the shore.',
'Maybe the Indians caught up with them, or they got to squabbling amongst themselves over their prize, kill each other off.',
'The Indians wrap them up and bury them.',
'A couple of hundred years later, Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.',
'Takes it away, maybe to Akator.',
'But then he returns it here.',
'Return.',
'Return, like he wrote on the walls of his cell.',
'He put it back where he found it. Why?',
'Hello, Jonesy.',
'Hello, Mac.',
'You’re lucky I turned up, Jonesy.',
'Dovchenko there wanted to blow your brains out.',
'That’s the third time I’ve saved your life.',
'Unshackle me. I’ll give you a big hug.',
'You had a Luger pointed at the base of your skull the first time we met.',
'I had the situation under control.',
'You owe me.',
'What do you owe them?',
'After the war, when you turned, how many names did you give the Reds?',
'You’re not looking at the big picture here.',
'How many good men died because of you?',
'Eventually, they’re gonna let me out of this chair, comrade, and when they do, I’m going to break your nose.',
'“Comrade”? You think this is about flags?',
'About uniforms? You think this is about lines on a map?',
'It’s just about money, isn’t it?',
'No. Not only money.',
'A gigantic pile of money.',
'Don’t worry about what the Russians will pay.',
'It’s nothing compared to what’s at Akator.',
'An entire city of gold. It’s what the conquistadors were after.',
'For God’s sake, Jonesy, we’d be rich! Richer than Howard Hughes!',
'Blood money, every nickel.',
'I need you to see the angle here, mate.',
'Be smart. Do the right thing. Just like in…',
'Like in Berlin. Got me?',
'Just like in Berlin.',
'You want me to trot off, or should we sing a song?',
'How fortunate our failure to kill you, Dr. Jones.',
'You survive to be of service to us once again.',
'Well, you know me, always glad to help.',
'“Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”',
'You recognize those words?',
'It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer after he created the atomic bomb.',
'He was quoting the Hindu bible.',
'It was nuclear intimidation.',
'But now this next level of weapon is ours to have, yours to fear.',
'Weapon? What weapon?',
'A mind weapon.',
'A new frontier of psychic warfare. That was Stalin’s dream.',
'Now I know why Oxley put the skull back where he found it.',
'He knew you were looking for it.',
'That skull is no mere deity carving.',
'Surely you knew that the moment you laid eyes on it.',
'It was not made by human hands.',
'Who made it, then?',
'Come on.',
'The body we found in New Mexico was not the first.',
'We’d already dissected two others from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.',
'Saucer men from Mars.',
'The legends about Akator are all true.',
'Early men could not have conceived it, much less built it.',
'It was a city of supreme beings with technologies and paranormal abilities.',
'You got to be kidding me.',
'Why do you choose not to believe your own eyes?',
'The New Mexico specimen gave us hope.',
'Unlike the others we’d found, its skeleton was pure crystal.',
'A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they too were sent to find Akator.',
'Perhaps we’re all searching for the same thing.',
'There is no other explanation.',
'There’s always another explanation.',
'The skull was stolen from Akator in the fifteenth century.',
'Whoever returns it…',
'Returns it to the city temple will gain control over its powers.',
'I’ve heard that bedtime story before.',
'It’s a legend. Why do you think Akator even existed?',
'You should ask your friend that question.',
'We’re certain he’s been there.',
'Oxley?',
'Ox, it’s me, Indy.',
'Ox?',
'Ox, you’re faking it, right?',
'“Through eyes that last I saw in tears…”',
'Ox, listen to me, pal. Your name is Harold Oxley.',
'You were born in Leeds, England.',
'You and I went to school together at the University of Chicago.',
'And you were never this interesting. My name is…',
'My name is Henry Jones, Jr.',
'What have you done to him?',
'We ain’t done a thing. It’s the bloody skull.',
'He is the divining rod that will lead us to Akator.',
'But we need someone to interpret him for us.',
'His mind, it seems, is quite weak. Let’s hope yours is stronger.',
'The skull’s crystal stimulates an undeveloped part of the human brain, opening a psychic channel.',
'Oxley lost control of his mind by staring too long into its eyes.',
'We believe you can get through to him after you have done the same.',
'I’ve got a better idea. You look at it.',
'The skull does not speak to everyone, it seems.',
'Surely you’re not afraid, Dr. Jones.',
'You’ve spent your entire life searching for answers.',
'Think of the truth behind those eyes.',
'There may be hundreds of skulls at Akator.',
'Whoever finds them will control the greatest natural force the world has ever known.',
'Power over the mind of man.',
'Be careful, you might get exactly what you wish for.',
'I usually do.',
'Imagine.',
'To peer across the world and know the enemy’s secrets.',
'To place our thoughts into the minds of your leaders.',
'Make your teachers teach the true version of history, your soldiers attack on our command.',
'We’ll be everywhere at once, more powerful than a whisper, invading your dreams, thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep.',
'We will change you, Dr. Jones, all of you, from the inside.',
'We will turn you into us.',
'And the best part? You won’t even know it’s happening.',
'Return.',
'Return?',
'That’s enough.',
'That’s enough. If he dies, we can’t get there.',
'Cover it.',
'Henry.',
'You all right, Jonesy?',
'You broke my nose!',
'I told you.',
'Enough! You will speak to Oxley and lead us to Akator, yes?',
'Take him outside.',
'You all right, kid?',
'They left my bike at the cemetery.',
'Yeah, but you’re all right?',
'They left my bike.',
'Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.',
'I’m ready. Don’t give these pigs a thing.',
'You heard him.',
'Clearly I have chosen the wrong pressure point.',
'Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.',
'Get your hands off me, you rotten Russki son of a bitch!',
'Indiana Jones.',
'About time you showed up.',
'Mom!',
'Sweetheart.',
'“Mom”?',
'What are you doing here?',
'Forget about me. Are you all right?',
'“Mom”?!',
'Young man, I specifically told you not to come here.',
'Marion is your mother?',
'You never wrote that. You never said that in any phone calls.',
'Marion Ravenwood is your mother?',
'For God’s sake, Indy, it’s not that hard.',
'No, I mean, I just never thought…',
'I would have a life after you left.',
'That’s not what I meant.',
'A damn good life!',
'Well, that’s fine.',
'A damn good, really good life!',
'Well, so have I!',
'Yeah?',
'You still leaving a trail of human wreckage, or have you retired?',
'Why? You looking for a date?',
'With anybody but you.',
'So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?',
'A simple “yes” will do.',
'Oh, Marion, you had to go and get yourself kidnapped.',
'Not like you did any better.',
'Same old, same old.',
'Henry Jones, Jr.',
'Henry Jones, Jr.…',
'That’s right, Ox. Listen to me.',
'“To lay their just hands on that Golden Key that ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”',
'Palace of…',
'It’s from Milton. He’s said it before. Why?',
'Ox, you got to tell us how to get to Akator or they’re gonna kill Marion.',
'“Through eyes that last I saw in tears, here in death’s dream kingdom…”',
'Harold, they’re gonna kill Abner’s little girl.',
'You got to tell us how to get there. We need…',
'Get me paper. Something to write with.',
'Autowriting! I should have seen this.',
'Henry Jones, Jr.',
'Right. That’s right, Ox.',
'Three times it drops. The way down.',
'Three times…',
'Pictographs.',
'Ideograms.',
'Good, Ox. Good.',
'Ox?',
'It’s me, Ox.',
'It’s Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me. Look at me. It’s me.',
'It’s me.',
'The wavy lines mean water, of course. Closed eyes mean sleep.',
'The sun with the arc over the sky stands for time, duration.',
'The word “now” is “until”.',
'These two close together, the horizon and the snake, mean one thought.',
'The horizon stood for the world, but it didn’t mean the earth. It meant big, great.',
'“The water sleeps until the great snake.”',
'These aren’t just drawings, they’re directions. Get me a map!',
'The great snake is the Amazon, of course, but “sleep”, what water sleeps?',
'Here! Sono. The Portuguese word for “sleep”.',
'Yes, good. Exactly.',
'He wants us to follow this curve of the Sono down to where it meets the Amazon to the southeast.',
'After that, I’m not sure.',
'Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes… I have no idea what he means.',
'This could be the route, though.',
'It’s a completely unexplored part of the canopy.',
'Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!',
'Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?',
'They were going to kill us!',
'Well, maybe.',
'Somebody had to do something!',
'Something else would have been good.',
'At least I got a plan.',
'This is intolerable. Harold, for God’s sake, keep up.',
'Mom?',
'Stay back!',
'Stop! Stop! Stop! Don’t move.',
'Moving makes space, space will make you sink.',
'No, I think I can get out if I can just…',
'Stop it! You’re pulling against a vacuum.',
'It’s like trying to lift a car. Just stay calm.',
'Okay, I’m calm.',
'What is it? Quicksand?',
'I’m calm.',
'No, it’s a dry sand pit.',
'I’m sinking, but I’m calm.',
'Quicksand is a mix of sand, mud and water.',
'And depending on the viscosity, it’s not as dangerous as people sometimes think.',
'For Pete’s sake, Jones, we’re not in school!',
'Don’t worry. There’s nothing to worry about unless there’s a—',
'A void collapse.',
'I’ll go get something to pull you out.',
'Ox, don’t just sit there. For God’s sake, man, go get help!',
'Help?',
'Help! Help! Help! Go!',
'Mutt can be a little impetuous.',
'It’s not the worst quality in the world.',
'Keep your arms above the surface. When the kid comes back, grab on.',
'Indy, he…',
'He’s a good kid, Marion.',
'You should get off his back about school.',
'Mutt, I mean…',
'Not everybody’s cut out for it.',
'His name is Henry.',
'Henry. Good name.',
'He’s your son.',
'My son?',
'Henry Jones III.',
'Why the hell didn’t you make him finish school?!',
'Mom, grab on!',
'Yeah.',
'Grab it!',
'I got it.',
'Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!',
'Pull!',
'Grab on.',
'Grab it.',
'Just grab it, Indy.',
'It’s a rat snake!',
'Rat snakes aren’t that big.',
'Well, this one is, all right? It’s not even poisonous. Now grab on!',
'Go get something else.',
'Like what?',
'Like a rope or something.',
'There’s no Sears and Roebuck here! Grab the snake!',
'Maybe I can touch the bottom.',
'There’s no bottom. Now grab it.',
'No, I think I can feel it with my feet.',
'Grab the snake!',
'Stop calling it that!',
'It’s a snake! What do you want me to call it?',
'Say “rope”!',
'What?',
'Say, “Grab the rope”!',
'Grab the rope!',
'Hold tight. It’s slimy.',
'Pull!',
'Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?',
'Afraid of snakes.',
'You are one crazy old man.',
'Why do you have to do everything the hard way, Jonesy?',
'Good work, Ox. Thanks.',
'Help.',
'No. No, he was British. My dad was an RAF pilot.',
'He was a war hero, not some schoolteacher!',
'No, sweetheart. Colin was your stepfather.',
'We started dating when you were three months old.',
'He was a good man.',
'Wait, wait, wait. Colin? As in Colin Williams? You…',
'You married him? I introduced you!',
'I think you gave up your vote on who I married when you decided to break it off a week before the wedding!',
'I think we both knew, Marion, it wasn’t going to work.',
'You didn’t know that. Why didn’t you ever talk to me about it?',
'Because we never had an argument I won!',
'It’s not my fault if you can’t keep up!',
'I didn’t want to hurt you!',
'For love of God, shut the hell up!',
'Didn’t you ever wonder years ago why Ox stopped talking to you?',
'He hated that you ran away.',
'Would you two just stop?',
'Yeah, Marion, let’s not let the kid see mom and dad fight.',
'You’re not my dad, okay?',
'You bet I am.',
'And I got news for you.',
'You’re gonna go back and finish school.',
'Really? What happened to, “There’s not a damn thing wrong with it, kid, and don’t let anybody else tell you any different”?',
'You don’t remember saying that?',
'That was before I was your father!',
'You’re not my father!',
'Oh, yes, he is your father.',
'You should have told me about the kid, Marion.',
'I had a right to know.',
'You vanished after that.',
'I wrote.',
'A year later!',
'By then, Mutt was born and I was married!',
'Why are you bothering to tell me now?',
'Because I thought we were gonna die!',
'Not yet!',
'Got it?',
'Oh, shit.',
'I’m sure I wasn’t the only one to go on with my life.',
'There must’ve been plenty of women for you over the years.',
'Yeah. There were a few, but they all had the same problem.',
'Yeah? What’s that?',
'They weren’t you, honey.',
'We got to get Oxley back, get our hands on that skull, and get to Akator before they do. Grab the wheel.',
'What’s he gonna do now?',
'I don’t think he plans that far ahead.',
'Yeah.',
'Scooch over, will you, Son?',
'Don’t call me “Son”. Don’t.',
'I think I’d cover my ears if I were you.',
'Duck! Duck!',
'Move, move!',
'Pull up next to that duck.',
'Henry Jones, Jr.',
'Jones!',
'Come on! Come on!',
'Get down!',
'Ox has got the skull. Marion, take the wheel.',
'That’s not fair. She drove the truck.',
'Don’t be a child. Find something to fight with.',
'Jonesy!',
'Jonesy?',
'Hi, Mac.',
'Indy. Indy! Indy!',
'Shut up! Shut up!',
'You stupid son of a bitch! I’m CIA.',
'CIA?',
'I almost screamed it at you in the tent. I said, “Just like Berlin.”',
'What were we in Berlin, mate?',
'Double agents!',
'The skull!',
'Throw me the skull!',
'Riposte.',
'Get on your front foot. Riposte.',
'It’s not a match, Mom.',
'You fight like a young man, eager to begin, quick to finish.',
'Mutt, disengage!',
'Hey! Hey, I got the skull!',
'Throw the bag! Throw it!',
'Throw the bag!',
'Gun! Gun!',
'What are you looking at, Daddy-o? She’s getting away!',
'This is very dangerous.',
'Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.',
'Jones!',
'Whoa.',
'Whoa!',
'Turn!',
'Siafu.',
'What?',
'Big damn ants! Go!',
'Run to the river!',
'Get to the river!',
'Jump in! Come on! Come on!',
'Mom, there’s a cliff!',
'Jonesy, come on!',
'Get in, Jones!',
'Mom, stop.',
'Mom, slow down.',
'Honey, stop.',
'Slow down, Mom.',
'You’re gonna go off the cliff.',
'That’s the idea.',
'Bad idea. Give me the wheel.',
'Trust me!',
'Slow down!',
'Don’t ever do that again.',
'Yes, dear.',
'Three times it drops…',
'Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!',
'I’m trying! I’m trying!',
'Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!',
'The way down.',
'He means by land. He came by land.',
'Three times it drops?',
'Three times it drops.',
'What is he talking about?',
'He means one!',
'Two!',
'Three.',
'You okay? Babe? Let go.',
'“Through eyes that last I saw in tears.”',
'“The golden vision reappears!”',
'Gold. I’m in.',
'Through eyes… Through eyes in tears. We got to go through that waterfall!',
'The skull has to be returned. I’ll do it. Nobody else has to come.',
'Who cares?',
'It’s brought us nothing but trouble.',
'Look what it did to him.',
'I have to return it.',
'Why you?',
'Because it told me to.',
'Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.',
'Oxy, stay with us.',
'How old is this?',
'Four or five thousand years. Old as the pyramids.',
'Look, sun worshippers, like the Egyptians.',
'This is fresh. These were just used.',
'More worshippers.',
'Yeah, but that’s not the sun they’re worshiping.',
'Someone came and taught the Ugha farming.',
'Irrigation.',
'Ox, what is it?',
'I think I understand, Ox.',
'Someone came?',
'Are they the same?',
'There were more. Look.',
'Thirteen in a circle.',
'Show us the way, Ox.',
'Let’s go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!',
'Go!',
'Indy!',
'Jonesy!',
'Oxley!',
'You were here before. How did you get past them?',
'Come on, Mac. Come on! Come on, Mac.',
'Come on, come on, come on!',
'“To lay their just hands on that Golden Key that ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”',
'Come on, Ox.',
'You did good, Ox. You did good.',
'City of gold. So where’s all the gold?',
'Look at the state of this place. What a stupid legend. What a waste of my time.',
'Ox was here before, but he couldn’t get into the temple, so he took the skull back to the cemetery, where he found it.',
'“To lay their just hands on that Golden Key that ope’s the Palace of Eternity…”',
'Key that ope’s the palace.',
'The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?',
'What are you looking for, Ox?',
'What are you doing?',
'You figured this out in your cell, didn’t you, Professor?',
'Excuse me, Professor.',
'Well done.',
'Go get your own.',
'Listen.',
'Hear that?',
'Get up! Move! Ox, move!',
'Faster! Faster!',
'Faster!',
'This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!',
'Quick! Quick! Quick!',
'I don’t like this! I don’t like it!',
'Mom, come on!',
'Jonesy!',
'He dropped it. He dropped the skull!',
'Okay?',
'Hold this.',
'Ox, you okay?',
'Lovely.',
'All right, let’s go.',
'This way?',
'Now that’s more like it.',
'There are artifacts from every era of early history.',
'Macedonian.',
'Sumerian.',
'This place is the mother lode.',
'Etruscan. Babylonian.',
'There isn’t a museum in the world that wouldn’t sell its soul for this lot.',
'Early Egyptian.',
'Dozens of museums. Hundreds of them, Jonesy!',
'Collectors.',
'They were archeologists.',
'How do we open it?',
'I’ll give it back, Ox. I promise.',
'No more forever waiting.',
'Soon now.',
'Sorry, Jonesy.',
'So what are you, a triple agent?',
'Nah, I just lied about being a double.',
'Look at them!',
'Still waiting for the return of the one who was lost.',
'They are a hive mind.',
'One being physically separate, but with a collective consciousness.',
'More powerful together than they can ever be apart.',
'Imagine what they could tell us.',
'I can’t imagine.',
'Neither could the humans that built this temple, and neither can you.',
'Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift you have yet to receive.',
'My sympathies.',
'Oh, I believe, sister. That’s why I’m down here.',
'Mayan. He’s speaking Mayan.',
'What does he say?',
'He says he’s grateful, and he wants it.',
'It wants to give us a gift.',
'A big gift.',
'Tell me everything you know.',
'I want to know everything. I want to know.',
'I’ve got a bad feeling about this.',
'Indy?',
'The eyes.',
'What are they? Spacemen?',
'Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.',
'Welcome back, Ox.',
'What the hell is that?',
'A portal! A pathway to another dimension!',
'I don’t think we want to go that way.',
'I want to know.',
'Tell me. I’m ready. I want to know.',
'Mac! Mac! Come on!',
'Mac!',
'Mac, damn it, now!',
'I can see.',
'I can see!',
'Grab it!',
'Use your legs, Mac. I can’t do it alone.',
'Jonesy!',
'I’m going to be all right.',
'No more!',
'Cover it. Cover it.',
'Go!',
'Enough!',
'Go! Go!',
'Like a broom to their footprints.',
'Where did they go? Space?',
'Not into space. Into the space between spaces.',
'I don’t understand.',
'Why this legend of a city of gold?',
'The Ugha word for gold translates as “treasure”.',
'But their treasure wasn’t gold. It was knowledge.',
'Knowledge was their treasure.',
'What? We’re just going to sit here?',
'Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.',
'You don’t want to climb down the mountain in the dark.',
'No?',
'I can. Who’s coming with me? Come on.',
'Why don’t you stick around, Junior?',
'Huh. I don’t know. Why didn’t you, Dad?',
'Dad! …Dad?',
'Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.',
'Marvelous! Perfect! Make the letters bigger, much bigger.',
'Henry Jones, Jr., and Marion Ravenwood, insomuch in that you two have agreed to live together in holy matrimony, have promised your love for each other by these vows, the joining of your hands, and the giving of these rings, I now declare you to be husband and wife.',
'Whom God hath put together, let no one tear asunder.',
'“How much of human life is lost in waiting.”',
'Congratulations. You may kiss your bride.',
'Well done, Henry!',
'Thanks, Ox.',
